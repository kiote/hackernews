# Connection Prompts

Structured prompts for finding and articulating connections between concepts.

## Connection Types

### Type C1: Surface Connection
Obvious, immediate relationship.

```
"[A] and [B] both involve [shared attribute]"
"[A] leads to [B] through [mechanism]"
"[A] is a type of [B]" / "[B] contains [A]"
```

### Type C2: Structural Connection
Same pattern, different domain.

```
"[A] is to [X] as [B] is to [Y]"
"Both [A] and [B] have [structural pattern]"
"[A] and [B] are isomorphic in [dimension]"
```

### Type C3: Functional Connection
Serve similar purposes.

```
"Both [A] and [B] solve [problem type]"
"[A] and [B] both enable [capability]"
"[A] could replace [B] for [use case]"
```

### Type C4: Oppositional Connection
Define each other through contrast.

```
"[A] and [B] are opposite poles of [dimension]"
"[A] is what [B] is not"
"The tension between [A] and [B] creates [emergent]"
```

### Type C5: Causal Connection
One leads to or from the other.

```
"[A] causes [B] through [mechanism]"
"[B] requires [A] as prerequisite"
"[A] and [B] co-evolve because [reason]"
```

### Type C6: Hidden Connection
Non-obvious, requires insight.

```
"Surprisingly, [A] and [B] share [unexpected commonality]"
"[A] and [B] are actually both instances of [deeper pattern]"
"The connection between [A] and [B] reveals [insight]"
```

## Connection Discovery Prompts

### Direct Inquiry

```
"What is the relationship between [A] and [B]?"

"How would you get from [A] to [B] in three steps or fewer?"

"What do [A] and [B] have in common that's not obvious?"

"If [A] and [B] had a conversation, what would they discuss?"

"What would change about [A] if [B] didn't exist?"
```

### Attribute Mining

```
"List 10 attributes of [A]. Which also apply to [B]?"

"What categories contain both [A] and [B]?"

"What problems do both [A] and [B] solve?"

"What constraints do both [A] and [B] operate under?"

"What history do [A] and [B] share?"
```

### Bridging

```
"What concept sits between [A] and [B]?"

"What third thing connects [A] and [B]?"

"If [A] and [B] were nodes, what would the edges be?"

"What transformation turns [A] into [B]?"

"What do you need to add to [A] to get [B]?"
```

### Perspective Shifts

```
"From the perspective of [domain], how are [A] and [B] related?"

"How would a child describe the connection between [A] and [B]?"

"What metaphor captures the relationship between [A] and [B]?"

"If [A] and [B] were in a story, what role would each play?"

"What would [A] say to [B], and how would [B] respond?"
```

## Connection Articulation Templates

### Simple Connection
```
"[A] connects to [B] through [mechanism/attribute/relationship]."
```

### Analogical Connection
```
"[A] relates to [B] the way [X] relates to [Y]:
 both involve [shared pattern]."
```

### Chain Connection
```
"[A] → [intermediate 1] → [intermediate 2] → [B]
 The path runs through [theme]."
```

### Insight Connection
```
"The connection between [A] and [B] reveals:
 [deeper principle or surprising insight]"
```

### Generative Connection
```
"Connecting [A] and [B] suggests:
 [new possibility, question, or direction]"
```

## Multi-Concept Connection

When connecting more than two concepts:

### Hub Model
Find a central concept that connects to all others.
```
     [B]
      |
[A]--[Hub]--[C]
      |
     [D]

"[Hub] connects all of these because [reason]"
```

### Chain Model
Concepts link in sequence.
```
[A] → [B] → [C] → [D]

"The progression from [A] to [D] follows [trajectory]"
```

### Cluster Model
Related concepts form groups.
```
[A, B] relate through [X]
[C, D] relate through [Y]
[X] and [Y] connect through [Z]
```

### Web Model
Multiple interconnections.
```
[A]--[B]
 |\  /|
 | \/ |
 | /\ |
 |/  \|
[C]--[D]

"This web of connections suggests [emergent pattern]"
```

## Connection Quality Assessment

Rate connections on:

| Dimension | Question | Scale |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| **Validity** | Is this connection real/accurate? | Spurious → Solid |
| **Novelty** | Is this connection surprising? | Obvious → Revelatory |
| **Utility** | Does this connection help with anything? | Trivial → Transformative |
| **Depth** | Does this reveal something fundamental? | Surface → Deep |
| **Generativity** | Does this connection suggest new directions? | Dead-end → Fertile |

**Strong connections** score high on at least 2-3 dimensions.
