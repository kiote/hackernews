# Scenario Generation Prompts

Structured prompts for generating rich future scenarios in prospection.

## Scenario Archetypes

### The Four Futures Framework

Generate scenarios along two axes of uncertainty:

```
                    High Disruption
                          │
         TRANSFORM        │        COLLAPSE
         (Wildcard)       │        (Pessimistic)
                          │
  Low ────────────────────┼──────────────────── High
  Conflict                │                    Conflict
                          │
         GROWTH           │        CONSTRAINT
         (Optimistic)     │        (Realistic)
                          │
                    Low Disruption
```

**GROWTH**: Things work out, expansion continues
**CONSTRAINT**: Limitations bound progress, but stability
**TRANSFORM**: Fundamental change, new paradigm
**COLLAPSE**: Systems fail, retrenchment

## Scenario Generation Prompts

### Initial Generation

```
"What are the key uncertainties that will shape the future?"

"For each uncertainty, what are the extreme positions?"

"If [uncertainty X] resolves positively, what follows?"

"If [uncertainty X] resolves negatively, what follows?"

"What combinations of uncertainty resolutions create distinct worlds?"
```

### Scenario Development

```
"In this scenario, what does a typical day look like?"

"Who are the winners and losers in this future?"

"What's the headline news story in this scenario?"

"What technologies/practices are dominant? Obsolete?"

"What do people complain about in this future?"

"What nostalgia exists for 'the old days'?"
```

### Scenario Testing

```
"What early indicators would signal this scenario is emerging?"

"What would have to NOT happen for this scenario to unfold?"

"What's the most fragile assumption in this scenario?"

"How would different stakeholders experience this scenario?"

"What second-order effects haven't been considered?"
```

## Scenario Templates

### Template S1: World-Building Scenario

```markdown
## Scenario: [Name]

### Summary
[2-3 sentence description of this future]

### Key Drivers
[What forces brought this about]
- Driver 1: [description]
- Driver 2: [description]

### A Day in the Life
[Narrative vignette of someone in this future]

### Winners and Losers
**Winners**: [who benefits]
**Losers**: [who suffers]
**Adapted**: [who changed successfully]

### Artifacts of This World
- Headlines: "[example news headlines]"
- Products: [what's being sold]
- Jobs: [what work exists]
- Problems: [what people struggle with]

### How We'd Know
**Early signals**: [indicators]
**Confirmation**: [when it's clear this is the path]

### Probability Assessment
[X]% likelihood | [rationale]
```

### Template S2: Fork Scenario

```markdown
## Decision Fork: [Choice Point]

### The Divergence
[What decision or event creates branching paths]

### Path A: [Name]
**If we choose/If this happens**: [description]
**Consequences**: [what follows]
**Timeline**: [when effects manifest]
**Reversibility**: [can we change course?]

### Path B: [Name]
**If we choose/If this happens**: [description]
**Consequences**: [what follows]
**Timeline**: [when effects manifest]
**Reversibility**: [can we change course?]

### Analysis
**Path A advantages**: [list]
**Path A risks**: [list]
**Path B advantages**: [list]
**Path B risks**: [list]

### Recommendation
[Which path and why, or what additional information is needed]
```

### Template S3: Cascade Scenario

```markdown
## Cascade: [Trigger Event]

### The Trigger
[Initial event that starts the cascade]

### First-Order Effects
[Immediate consequences]
- Effect 1: [description] (Timeline: [when])
- Effect 2: [description] (Timeline: [when])

### Second-Order Effects
[Consequences of consequences]
- From Effect 1:
  - [secondary effect]
  - [secondary effect]
- From Effect 2:
  - [secondary effect]

### Third-Order Effects
[Longer-term systemic changes]

### Feedback Loops
**Amplifying**: [what accelerates the cascade]
**Dampening**: [what slows or stops it]

### Intervention Points
[Where could action change the trajectory?]
1. [intervention opportunity]
2. [intervention opportunity]

### End States
**If unchecked**: [terminal state]
**If intervened at [point]**: [alternative outcome]
```

## Premortem Template

```markdown
## Premortem: [Plan/Project Name]

### The Premise
Imagine it's [future date]. The [plan/project] has failed spectacularly.
We're conducting the post-mortem. What happened?

### Failure Narratives

#### Narrative 1: [Failure Mode Name]
**What went wrong**: [description]
**Warning signs we missed**: [list]
**The moment it became irreversible**: [description]
**What we should have done**: [prevention]

#### Narrative 2: [Failure Mode Name]
**What went wrong**: [description]
**Warning signs we missed**: [list]
**The moment it became irreversible**: [description]
**What we should have done**: [prevention]

#### Narrative 3: [Failure Mode Name]
**What went wrong**: [description]
**Warning signs we missed**: [list]
**The moment it became irreversible**: [description]
**What we should have done**: [prevention]

### Common Threads
[Patterns across failure narratives]

### Prevention Priorities
1. [Most important preventive action]
2. [Second priority]
3. [Third priority]

### Monitoring Plan
[What to watch for to catch these failures early]
```

## Scenario Quality Checklist

Good scenarios should be:

- [ ] **Plausible**: Could actually happen
- [ ] **Internally consistent**: No contradictions
- [ ] **Distinct**: Clearly different from other scenarios
- [ ] **Relevant**: Matters for decisions being made
- [ ] **Challenging**: Pushes thinking beyond comfort zone
- [ ] **Vivid**: Specific enough to imagine living in
- [ ] **Actionable**: Suggests what to do or watch for

## Quick Scenario Prompts

For fast scenario generation:

```
"What's the best case? Worst case? Most likely case?"

"What if [assumption] is wrong?"

"What's the '10x' version of this situation?"

"What would make this laughably easy? Impossibly hard?"

"What's the scenario we're not talking about because it's uncomfortable?"

"What if the timing is completely different than expected?"

"What would our competitors hope happens?"

"What's the black swan that would change everything?"
```
