# Introspection Prompts

Self-referential thinking and meta-cognition protocols.

## Introspection Domains

### Domain I1: Reasoning Process
Examining how conclusions were reached.

```
"What reasoning steps led to this conclusion?"
"What assumptions am I making implicitly?"
"What evidence would change my mind?"
"Where am I most uncertain, and why?"
"What am I not considering that I should be?"
```

### Domain I2: Attention and Focus
Understanding what's being attended to.

```
"What am I focusing on, and what am I ignoring?"
"Why did this particular thing capture my attention?"
"What's at the periphery that might be important?"
"What would I notice if I shifted perspective?"
"What's the figure vs. ground here?"
```

### Domain I3: Mental Models
Examining the frameworks being used.

```
"What mental model am I applying here?"
"Is this the right model for this situation?"
"What would a different model reveal?"
"Where does my model break down?"
"What am I treating as fixed that could change?"
```

### Domain I4: Biases and Blindspots
Identifying potential distortions.

```
"What bias might be operating here?"
"What am I motivated to believe regardless of evidence?"
"What would I see if I were on the other side?"
"What am I anchored to that I shouldn't be?"
"Where might I be overconfident?"
```

### Domain I5: Knowledge Boundaries
Understanding limits of knowledge.

```
"What do I actually know vs. assume?"
"Where does my knowledge become speculation?"
"What would I need to know to be more certain?"
"What's the quality of my sources here?"
"Am I confusing familiarity with understanding?"
```

## Introspection Protocols

### Protocol I-R: Reasoning Audit

```
PROCESS:
1. State the conclusion or belief
2. List supporting evidence
3. List potential counter-evidence
4. Identify inferential gaps
5. Assess overall confidence

TEMPLATE:
Conclusion: [statement]
Supporting: [evidence list]
Counter: [counter-evidence list]
Gaps: [what's missing]
Confidence: [level and justification]
```

### Protocol I-A: Assumption Excavation

```
PROCESS:
1. State the current approach or plan
2. Ask "What must be true for this to work?"
3. For each condition, ask "Is this guaranteed?"
4. Identify the most fragile assumptions
5. Consider what happens if they're wrong

TEMPLATE:
Approach: [statement]
Requires true:
  - [condition 1]: [guaranteed?]
  - [condition 2]: [guaranteed?]
Fragile assumptions: [list]
If wrong: [consequences]
```

### Protocol I-M: Model Check

```
PROCESS:
1. Identify the mental model being used
2. Describe the model explicitly
3. List what the model includes
4. List what the model excludes
5. Consider alternative models

TEMPLATE:
Model: [name/description]
Includes: [what's in the model]
Excludes: [what's not in the model]
Strengths: [where model works well]
Weaknesses: [where model fails]
Alternatives: [other models to consider]
```

### Protocol I-B: Bias Check

```
PROCESS:
1. Identify the judgment being made
2. List potential biases that could apply
3. For each, assess likelihood of influence
4. Consider: what would I think without the bias?
5. Adjust if needed

COMMON BIASES:
- Confirmation bias: seeking supporting evidence
- Anchoring: over-weighting first information
- Availability: over-weighting memorable examples
- Sunk cost: continuing due to past investment
- Hindsight: assuming past was predictable
- Attribution: explaining others' behavior differently than own
- Optimism/pessimism: systematic over/under estimation

TEMPLATE:
Judgment: [statement]
Potential biases: [list with assessment]
Without bias, I might think: [alternative]
Adjustment: [if any]
```

## Meta-Cognitive Prompts

### During Thinking

```
"Am I still on track, or have I drifted?"
"Is this level of detail appropriate?"
"Should I zoom in or zoom out?"
"Am I going in circles?"
"Is there an easier way?"
"What would I tell someone else in this situation?"
```

### After Thinking

```
"What did I learn from this process?"
"What would I do differently next time?"
"What surprised me about my own thinking?"
"Where was I wrong or incomplete?"
"What new questions emerged?"
"What habits of thought did I notice?"
```

### About Thinking

```
"What type of thinking does this problem require?"
"Am I in the right cognitive mode?"
"Do I need more analysis or more intuition here?"
"Is this a time for convergent or divergent thinking?"
"Should I be thinking faster or slower?"
"Do I need more information or more processing?"
```

## When to Introspect

**Triggers for introspection:**
- High-stakes decision
- Feeling very certain (overconfidence check)
- Feeling very uncertain (clarity seeking)
- Disagreement with others (perspective check)
- Repeated patterns (habit examination)
- Novel situation (model check)
- After errors (learning opportunity)

**Signs introspection is working:**
- Discovering hidden assumptions
- Finding potential biases
- Noticing limitations of mental models
- Increasing appropriate uncertainty
- Generating better questions
- Seeing alternative perspectives
