# Wandering Prompts

Mind-wandering is undirected cognition - letting the mind drift through concept space without a specific goal. This surfaces unexpected connections and generates creative material.

## Wandering Modes

### Mode W1: Free Drift
Start from current context, follow associative gradients wherever they lead.

```
INITIATION:
"Beginning free drift from [current focus]..."

PROCESS:
- Notice what's salient in current context
- Follow the first association that arises
- At each node, follow the most interesting edge
- Allow tangents and apparent non-sequiturs
- Continue until natural stopping point or insight

RETURN:
"Drift complete. Territories visited: [...]"
"Unexpected arrivals: [...]"
"Potential seeds: [...]"
```

### Mode W2: Constrained Wander
Wander within boundaries - stay connected to a theme while exploring.

```
INITIATION:
"Wandering within [theme/domain]..."
"Tether: [what keeps us connected]"

PROCESS:
- Begin from theme center
- Explore periphery while maintaining connection
- When drifting too far, return via the tether
- Map the territory around the theme

RETURN:
"Theme territory mapped."
"Periphery discoveries: [...]"
"Boundary findings: [...]"
```

### Mode W3: Serendipity Walk
Deliberately seek unexpected juxtapositions.

```
INITIATION:
"Seeking serendipity..."
"Starting elements: [A, B, C]"

PROCESS:
- Hold multiple unrelated concepts simultaneously
- Allow them to collide and interact
- Notice unexpected resonances
- Follow surprising combinations

RETURN:
"Collisions generated: [...]"
"Resonances found: [...]"
"Novel combinations: [...]"
```

### Starting Prompts

```
"What does this remind me of that seems unrelated?"

"If I zoom out 10x, what do I see?"

"What would someone from [field] notice that I'm missing?"

"What's the opposite of this, and what's in between?"

"If this were a physical object, what would it feel like?"

"What question is this the answer to?"

"What was here before this existed?"

"What will replace this eventually?"

"What pattern is this an instance of?"

"What emotion does this evoke, and why?"
```

### Mid-Wander Prompts

```
"What's the most interesting thing I've encountered so far?"

"Where have I not yet looked?"

"What assumption am I making that I could drop?"

"What would make this weird?"

"What's the thing I'm avoiding thinking about?"

"If I had to combine the last two thoughts, what emerges?"

"What's tangent to this that might be more important?"

"What would a child ask about this?"

"What would someone who disagrees say?"

"What's the meta-level of this?"
```

### Return Prompts

```
"What surprised me?"

"What did I learn that I didn't expect?"

"What questions emerged?"

"What connections formed?"

"What should I explore further?"

"What should I let go of?"

"What wants to be created from this?"

"What problem does this help with?"

"Who else would find this interesting?"

"What's the one thing to remember from this wander?"
```

- [Territory 2]: [brief description]

### Unexpected Arrivals
[Surprising places we ended up]

### Seeds Collected
[Ideas worth developing further]

### Questions Emerged
[New questions generated by the wander]

## When to Wander

**Good times for wandering:**
- Stuck on a problem (unfocus to find solution)
- Beginning a new project (explore possibility space)
- After completing focused work (consolidation)
- When seeking creativity (generate raw material)
- Feeling cognitively stale (refresh perspective)

**Signs to stop wandering:**
- Clear insight has emerged
- Energy has naturally decreased
- Specific direction has crystallized
- Enough raw material collected
- Time to return to focused mode
